    // TODO clean up combat model before implementing tests.
    // TODO not all described tests pass atm

    // TEST CASES:

    // Actor with higher net SL wins
    // Both actors can crit simultaneously
    // Actor can hit and fumble simultaneously
    // Location should map to roll
    // Crit roll should be unrelated to hit roll
}
